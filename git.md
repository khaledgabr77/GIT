## Version Control (Git)

# What is the Version Control (Git)?

Version control systems (VCSs) are tools used to track changes to source code (or other collections of files and folders). As the name implies, these tools help maintain a history of changes; furthermore, they facilitate collaboration. VCSs track changes to a folder and its contents in a series of snapshots, where each snapshot encapsulates the entire state of files/folders within a top-level directory. VCSs also maintain metadata like who created each snapshot, messages associated with each snapshot, and so on.

# Why is version control useful?

Even when you’re working by yourself, it can let you look at old snapshots of a project, keep a log of why certain changes were made, work on parallel branches of development, and much more. When working with others, it’s an invaluable tool for seeing what other people have changed, as well as resolving conflicts in concurrent development.

---

# Version Control Requirements

- Track Everything

```bash
<root> (tree)
|
+- foo (tree)
|  |
|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "HI Robotics Team")
|
+- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is Amazing")
```

In Git terminology, a file is called a `blob`, and it’s just a bunch of bytes. A directory is called a `tree`

# Modeling history

```bash
                      +Feature   
o <------- o <------- o <------- o +Feature
            ^                    ^  +Bug
             \                  /         
              --------- -------o 
                              +Bug
```

- OS Independent
- Unique ID

# Data model, as pseudocode

It may be instructive to see Git’s data model written down in pseudocode:

```bash
// a file is a bunch of bytes
type blob = array<byte>

// a directory contains named files and directories
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>

// a commit has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
type commit = struct {
    parents: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}
```

---

# Objects and content-addressing

```bash
type object = blob | tree | commit
```

In Git data store, all objects are content-addressed by their SHA-1 hash.

```bash
objects = map<string, object>

def store(object):
    id = sha1(object)
    objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return objects[id]
```

# SHA-1

```bash
khaled@khaled:~$ echo "Hello" | git hash-object --stdin
e965047ad7c57865823c7d992b1d046ea66edf78
```

# SHA-SUM

```bash
khaled@khaled:~$ echo "Hello" | shasum 
1d229271928d3f9e2bb0375bd6ce5db6c6d348d9  -
```

```bash
khaled@khaled:~$ echo "blob 6\0Hello"
blob 6\0Hello

khaled@khaled:~$ echo -e "blob 6\0Hello"
blob 6Hello

khaled@khaled:~$ echo -e "blob 6\0Hello" | shasum 
e965047ad7c57865823c7d992b1d046ea66edf78  -
```

# References

Now, all snapshots can be identified by their SHA-1 hashes. That’s inconvenient, because humans aren’t good at remembering strings of 40 hexadecimal characters.

---

Git’s solution to this problem is human-readable names for SHA-1 hashes, called “references”. References are pointers to commits. Unlike objects, which are immutable, references are mutable (can be updated to point to a new commit). For example, the master reference usually points to the latest commit in the main branch of development.

```bash
references = map<string, string>

def update_reference(name, id):
    references[name] = id

def read_reference(name):
    return references[name]

def load_reference(name_or_id):
    if name_or_id in references:
        return load(references[name_or_id])
    else:
        return load(name_or_id)
```

- Track History
- No Content Change

# 2-Tree Arch(other version control)

One way you might imagine implementing snapshotting as described above is to have a “create snapshot” command that creates a new snapshot based on the current state of the working directory. Some version control tools work like this, but not Git.

- Working Tree
- Repositories

---

# 3-Tree Arch(GIT)

- Working Tree
- Staging area
- Repositories

# Staging area

it’s a part of the interface to create commits.
We want clean snapshots, and it might not always be ideal to make a snapshot from the current state. For example, imagine a scenario where you’ve implemented two separate features, and you want to create two separate commits, where the first introduces the first feature, and the next introduces the second feature. Or imagine a scenario where you have debugging print statements added all over your code, along with a bugfix; you want to commit the bugfix while discarding all the print statements.

100644 blob 6b7935af7497b535cae9c6a8ca2d31f4092e69be test.txt
```

add a new line int the `test.txt` file.
check the file status.

```bash 
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git status 
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git status -s
 M test.txt
```

The red `M` the file not found in the `stage area` or the `repo`.

so you need to add the file:

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git add test.txt 
```

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git status -s
M  test.txt
```

The green `M` means you add the file to `the stage area`.

the file now in the stage area but we need to sent it to the repo. you need to commit

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git commit -m "sec line added"
[master 7a09670] sec line added
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

we expect git have 2 `commits` msgs, let's check:

---

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git log 
commit 7a0967019a20436ddb595f794553335fa1ecfae6 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Khaled Gabr <khaledgabr77@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 18 20:40:12 2023 +0200

    sec line added

commit 73271c63fd90b485ba75013c5fed3435417182da
Author: Khaled Gabr <khaledgabr77@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 18 18:18:32 2023 +0200

    inital commit
```

the log show much info like who did that when which email,...but i don't need to know theses info.

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git log --oneline
7a09670 (HEAD -> master) sec line added
73271c6 inital commit
```

okay you added file to repo let's check:

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ find .git//objects/ -type f
.git//objects/7a/0967019a20436ddb595f794553335fa1ecfae6

committer Khaled Gabr <khaledgabr77@gmail.com> 1681843212 +0200

sec line added
```

let's add a new line to the file `test.txt`

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git status -s
 M test.txt
```

The red `M` means the file not found in the `stage area` or the `repo`.

now let's introduce the `git diff` command this command make compear between the `WD`, `SA` and `repo`.

---

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git diff 
diff --git a/test.txt b/test.txt
index f6bd9dd..80e6e52 100644
--- a/test.txt
+++ b/test.txt
@@ -1,2 +1,3 @@
 Welcome to Git
 New Line Added to the file
+Again, add new line!
```

the comperasion here between the `WD` and `SA`.
let's add the change to the stage area by using command:

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git add .
```

now try to use the same command `git diff` again, you will found there is no output shown. because the command moved the changes to `SA`.

hmm, you now asking how to check the differnace between the `stage area` and `repo`.

```bash
khaled:~/GIT(master)$ git diff --staged 
diff --git a/test.txt b/test.txt

# Git command-line interface

`Basics`

- `git help <command>`: get help for a git command
- `git init`: creates a new git repo, with data stored in the .git directory
- `git status`: tells you what’s going on
- `git add <filename>`: adds files to staging area
- `git commit`: creates a new commit Write good commit messages! Even more reasons to write good commit messages!
- `git log`: shows a flattened log of history
- `git log --all --graph --decorate`: visualizes history as a DAG
- `git diff <filename>`: show changes you made relative to the staging area
- `git diff <revision> <filename>`: shows differences in a file between snapshots
- `git checkout <revision>`: updates HEAD and current branch

`Branching and merging`

- `git branch`: shows branches
- `git branch <name>`: creates a branch
- `git checkout -b <name>`: creates a branch and switches to
  - it same as `git branch <name>`; `git checkout <name>`

---

- `git merge <revision>`: merges into current branch
- `git mergetool`: use a fancy tool to help resolve merge conflicts
- `git rebase`: rebase set of patches onto a new base

`Remotes`

- `git remote`: list remotes
- `git remote add <name> <url>`: add a remote
- `git push <remote> <local branch>:<remote branch>`: send objects to remote, and update remote reference
- `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<remote branch>`: set up correspondence between local and remote branch
- `git fetch`: retrieve objects/references from a remote
- `git pull`: same as git fetch; git merge
- `git clone`: download repository from remote

`Undo`

- `git commit --amend`: edit a commit’s contents/message
- `git reset HEAD <file>`: unstage a file
- `git checkout -- <file>`: discard changes

---

`Advanced Git`

- `git config`: Git is highly customizable
- `git clone --depth=1`: shallow clone, without entire version history
- `git add -p`: interactive staging
- `git rebase -i`: interactive rebasing
- `git blame`: show who last edited which line
- `git stash`: temporarily remove modifications to working directory
- `git bisect`: binary search history (e.g. for regressions)
- `.gitignore`: specify intentionally untracked files to ignore
